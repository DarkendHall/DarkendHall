    <p>I am a Fullstack developer, proficient in several languages.</p>
    <p>During my studies several of the projects where group projects. In these projects I took on a bit more of an administrative role. Made sure we had a plan before we started any type of development. I was usually the one who set up CI/CD pipelines and made sure issues/project-boards were always up-to-date. If someone needed help, even if they were not a part of my team, I always tried to help them the best I could.</p>
    <p>I'm a hardworking team player, eager to learn new skills and build upon my existing ones.</p>

    <h3>Experience:</h3>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">

        <p><b>Internship at <a href="https://github.com/digitalroute">DigitalRoute</a></b></p>
        <p>
            I worked in one of their development teams that developed and maintained code written mainly in Java with UI:s in Swing (desktop) and Vaadin (Web).
              <br>
            Some of the day-to-day work included refactoring code to be compatible with both Vaadin and Swing, implementing new features as well as fixing bugs and SonarQube/SonarCloud issues.</p>

    <h3>School projects</h3>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
        <p><b>Thesis Project</b></p>
        <p>An application made with C# and WinForms. A GUI based application to increase the speed of configuring the installation of PowerShell AppDeployToolkit packages (PSADT).</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Final project for the course "Webservices": <a href="https://github.com/darkendhall/url_shortener">url_shortener</a></b></p>
        <p>A simple URL shortener, there are three different implementations for this service. A Spring Boot version, a Micronaut version and a Quarkus version. The Spring Boot version is the most "simple" version, it only supports building the java code into a docker image. The Quarkus version is almost the same as the Spring Boot version except the ability to package the application into a native image which can then be put in a docker image. The final version, the Micronaut version, also supports building into a native image which can then be put in a docker image, but also includes Consul service discovery functionality.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Final group project in Spring Boot for our "Java EE/Spring boot" course: <a href="https://github.com/DarkendHall/Slutprojekt_Java_EE">Slutprojekt_Java_EE</a></b></p>
        <p>We created a system for keeping track of the people attending and working at different schools. We set up a CI/CD pipeline, made it possible to send an email through a specific endpoint to all students in a specific course and made it so that when you create a new release a Docker image will be built and published to GitHub packages.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Class project in "Java tools & Build environments" course: <a href="https://github.com/fungover/storm">Storm</a></b></p>
        <p>A simple webserver implementation where we practiced using pull-requests, issues and a CI pipeline</p>
